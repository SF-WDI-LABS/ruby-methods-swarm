# Ruby Method Swarm Drill

### Why is this important?
<!-- framing the "why" in big-picture/real world examples -->
*This workshop is important because:*
Reading and understanding documentation is supremely important when learning a new programming language.  Documentation is written by the purveyor of the technology in the hopes that it will help you use its service to its fullest.  This lab will help you become familiarized with the Ruby Programming Language's documentation site and how to execute Ruby's endless methods.
### What are the objectives?
<!-- specific/measurable goal for students to achieve -->
*After this workshop, developers will be able to:*

- Understand how to find a desired piece of information at [Ruby-Doc.org](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/)
- Create your own documentation on how to utilize a chosen Ruby method in your every day coding
- Utilize a Ruby method in an original and effective manner


### Where should we be now? 
<!-- call out the skills that are prerequisites -->
*Before this workshop, developers should already be able to:*

- Identify basic Ruby primitives and collection types
- Evaluate and execute ruby code in a terminal or file.

### Team WDI: time to swarm!
We will be navigating the [ruby-doc.org](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/) website to quickly find, evaluate, synthesize, and teach one ruby method per student.  

You will be responsible for creating a github gist that will outline any important or notable information about a method or a string, hash, obect, integer, or array.  

## Requirements
The Gist must have the following:
1. A one or two sentence 'elevator pitch' that describes that the method does.
2. A clear outline of the method's required inputs (if any) and expected outputs (if any).
3. A snippet of ruby code that others can reproduce that will demonstrate your method's functionality.

## Resources
Where to find your methods:  
- [Document Home](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/) - this is the table of contents for all methods but we would prefer you choose a data type you know
- [Strings](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/String.html)
- [Math](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/Math.html)
- [Integer](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/Integer.html)
- [Hash](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/Hash.html)
- [Array](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/Array.html)


## Deliverables
[Here](https://gist.github.com/justincastilla/7c9cbda5858065a62c3788c4f4fe35ba) is an example of a gist covering the `Array.flatten!` method.

Be prepared to hold a lecture for 5 minutes outlining your specific method.  You may share your github gist via slack.  You may use the project and the whiteboard for further illustration.
